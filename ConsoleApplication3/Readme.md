>> <details><summary>story</summary>I saw a video on youtube. something like this:how to write your first program.and I wanted to start studying this business myself, but since I didnâ€™t have a smart computer, I just watched the video and tried not this language, but the HTML markup language, and something seemed to work out. I simultaneously studied at a technical school as a builder, but I did not like this profession. I finished my studies and went into the army, then I moved in with my brother and began to get serious, having bought myself a laptop before that, but at first I could not decide what I wanted and studied everything that was not nailed down, but soon I seriously decided to study C#</details>
